Some people or companies that really helped me during development
of this module:

Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>
     Marc is one of the authors of Perl and known for his high-performance
     pgcc-compiler. He answered a lot of question and even more important
     he asked a lot of questions.

Gerd Nachtsheim <gerd@nachtsheim.name>
     Gerd is a sales engineer of Intersystems and known for hating Perl.
     The fact that he is constantly talking down Perl motivated me a
     lot. He also suggested to release this framework to public which
     caused a lot of cleanup work to be done.

KW-Computer Ges.m.b.H <kwc@kwc.at>
     The company I (currently :) work for. I wrote parts of the first
     release of this framework in working hours. Cache-Perl runs
     on more than hundred sites in production. They allowed
     me to release parts of stuff I wrote under LGPL license.
