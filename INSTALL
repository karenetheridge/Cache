This is not a usual Perl-Module that you can
install out of the box.
You need to build a Perl with Cache embedded
(or Cache with Perl embedded) first.

The reason for this is that Intersystems
doesn't ship Cache as shared library.
It would be no problem for them.
Please complain.

Before you start make sure you have installed
Intersystems Cache (including source)
and the usual C environment that was used for
the build of your Perl...

I use: Cache for UNIX (Linux Intel/32-bit) 5.0.5 (Build 936) Fri Feb 6 2004 16:28:37 EST
but it's reported to work with 4.0.x, too.
My Perl is currently 5.8.3 built nearly as slow as possible (IThreads, Int64)

Here the instructions:

1. Building a new Cache:

   1. Edit gen/Makefile.unix
      and modify "PERL" and "CACHEDIR"
      "PERL" - should point to the Perl-binary you want to use.
      "CACHEDIR" - should point to the directory where Cache is installed.

   2. In directory ./gen run: 
      > make -f Makefile.unix
      this should create a "cache" binary.

2. Installing the new Cache binary.

   1. stop cache  - usually by running ./cstop in "CACHEDIR"
   2. In directory ./gen run:
      > make -f Makefile.unix install
   3. start cache - usually by running ./cstart in "CACHEDIR"

After that, you can install the package as expected:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Have fun - Stefan <oesi@cpan.org>
