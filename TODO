Since this is a complete rewrite of Cache-Perl 1.0
this package is not declared stable and lacks some
features:

1) embedded SQL support. (should be really easy to do,
   just like Cache::ObjectScript with the addition
   of allowing bind-out variables.

2) Cache Object support.
   This should be easy, too.
   I currently don't need it and Intersystems refuses
   to give me important informations I would need
   for that. Basically OO support means blessing a
   Cache oid to a proxy class that "autoloads" methods
   and allows access to "properties" by a tied hash.

3) This distribution does not include cacpp, a tool
   which creates .INC-Files out of Perl sources.
   Call-Out (which is heavily used on > 100 machines)
   is not documented here at all. I will add the
   stuff later.

4) I didn't added list_pack/list_unpack to the dist
   because it doesn't support all types that Cache
   supports - if Intersystems would provide exact
   specifications I would add it.
   It's interesting to note that list_pack is
   different to $LISTBUILD because Perl supports
   "undef". So while $LB() returns a single-element
   list with a undef value, list_pack() returns an
   empty string. list_pack(undef) == $LB().

5) AFTER Intersystems fixes THEIR bugs:
   - removing tty-fixup
   - removing signal-fixup
   - using delayed cache init on cperl
